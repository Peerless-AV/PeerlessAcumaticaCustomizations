### 6.3 Data Validation
- **2026-01-07 12:37 CST** — For the FayeWebEndPoint, I have confirmed in DEV (Peerless‑AV) that the endpoint is returning the field `usrStockLevel`. I also confirmed that in my Local environment, the field was not present prior to deployment of the package. After deploying the package locally as planned, the field appeared as expected.
